# MSc Neuroscience Research Project

This repository holds the code for my research project on applying ML to brain data to predict measures of cognitive abilities. I'm currently a MSc Neuroscience student at Western University and I'm working in [Bobby Stojanoski's](http://bobbystojanoski.com/) lab. To learn more about me, you can visit [my website](http://brianpho.com).

## Project Description

My research is based on the idea "Do great minds think alike?" This question came about from another research project that a PhD student was doing in Bobby's lab. The idea is to explore what brain structures enable high intelligence and cognition. To explore this idea, I will apply machine learning models to fMRI data in children and adolescents. I will use fMRI data during movie watching to generate a functional connectivity matrix for each subject, then I will feed that matrix into an ML model to predict their score on various cognitive measures. I plan to use the following cognitive measures: NIH Toolbox, WISC, WAIS, and KBIT.
