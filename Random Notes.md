# Random Notes

I use this file as a scratch pad for random notes that I've been given. Disregard this file.

Brian will apply machine learning and data science techniques on fMRI data (during a resting state and movie watching) and measures of cognitive abilities to identify differences between typically and atypically developing brains.

Are there a set of measures that differentiate typical vs atypical brains. Does this change over time?

Great minds think alike research idea. lit search on ML fmri intelligence cognition, executive function
Instead of psychiatric, look at cognitive measure

Generally, the first paragraph should be about what is currently known in the field, the 2nd paragraph (or the end of the first) should be about what is missing. 3rd paragraph is what you propose to do, 4th how you will do it and your last paragraph is a summary and what your proposal will add to the literature (by looping back to what you talked about in the intro). In your case, you spent too much time and gave too many details about ISC. It gave the impression that the proposal is about ISC. When in fact, ISC is one type of neural data you will use in your ML stuff. So I changed the intro (using something I have written in the past) to more generally describe the state of understanding cognition in kids.

a.       To check availability, type command: module avai
b.       To unload a default module (eg. matlab/2020a), type command: module unload matlab/2020a
c.       To load a non-default module (eg. matlab/2014a), type command: module load matlab/2014a

Each nifti file is a data point every 800 msec. Put all of them together to get. (aa module for 3D to 4D)

FC and ISC
Low and High cognitive abilities

Beware of duplicate folders/subjects
Maybe ignore ages 5/6 due to noise
